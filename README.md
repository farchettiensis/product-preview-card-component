## Overview

For this challenge, my main concern was CSS flexboxes and working with nested containers, which is why I didn't use semantic HTML.

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout depending on their device's screen size
- See hover and focus states for interactive elements

## My process

I started by writing the HTML code and the containers. Once the basic structure was built, I focused on centralizing the main box relative to the body of the page. From then, I worked from the outermost components all the way to the details.

### Built with

- HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox

### Continued development

This was my first dive into CSS and flexboxes. A lot of what I did was by trial and error, but I learned so much about CSS boxes, divs, and relative units. I intend to keep working on these elements and properties in my next projects.

### Useful resources

For this challenge, I used VsCode with a few extensions, mainly: Error Lens, Linter, and Live Server.

Also very handy, Borderleft's PX to REM calculator.

As per usual, Firefox Dev Tools were used throughout the process.
